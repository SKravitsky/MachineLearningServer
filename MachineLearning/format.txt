feautre_payload = time, day, latitude, longitude, UserID
features = time, day, lat, long

Persistent decision tree
Write the code two ways, one with a numpy array and one with just accepting an API line (JSON)
Save tree with pickle using the UserID

See how long it takes for making bigger trees (1,000 rows vs. 1,000,000 rows)
See how long it takes to pull SQL data then build the tree 
Weight older trips less?
